Infinirule is a virtual slide rule application for Android. It
transcends the limitations of real physical slide rules by allowing
variable precision--just keep zooming in to get more--and
automatically wrapping scales around--like a circular slide rule, but
without the bulk. And though it only shows four scales at a time,
you can select any combination of the available scale types.

Like most slide rules, Infinirule consists of 3 movable parts,
including the cursor. The top two scales move together, as do the
bottom two. Dragging the top half moves the entire rule left or right,
while dragging the bottom half only moves that. Use two fingers to
pinch-zoom the rule horizontally to adjust the precision. Dragging in
the space below or above the rule scales engages “precision” moving at
1/10th speed, for fine adjustments. You can move either the scales or
the cursor in this way.

Scale names are displayed as the formulas for computing their values,
rather than the traditional labels (“C”, “D” etc).
